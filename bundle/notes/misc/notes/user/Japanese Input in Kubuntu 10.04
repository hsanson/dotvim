Japanese Input in Kubuntu 10.04

# Introduction

Since Kubuntu 9.10 there is a movement away from skim [1] and into ibus [2]
that seems to be a better alternative. Unfortunately after my latest upgrade
to Kubuntu 10.04 this movement caused my Japanese input to stop working.  To
get Japanese working again using ibus was actually very easy and here I
explain the steps to do it.

# Uninstall SCIM/SKIM packages

First we uninstall all SCIM and SKIM related packages to avoid any kinds of
conflicts with the new iBus system.
{{{sh
sudo aptitude purge scim scim-anthy scim-bridge-agent \
scim-bridge-client-gtk scim-bridge-client-qt \
scim-bridge-client-qt4 scim-gtk2-immodule \
scim-hangul scim-qtimm scim-modules-table \
scim-tables-zh scim-uim
}}}

# Install iBus required packages

Second we install the iBus packages needed to support different language
input methods.
{{{sh
sudo aptitude install ibus ibus-qt4 ibus-gtk ibus-anthy
}}}

# Configure the system to auto-select the input method.

The im-switch utility is used to select input methods. For better results
make sure you select auto.
{{{sh
sudo im-switch -c
}}}

# Trouble Shooting

  • Japanese/Chinese/Korean/etc does not work in any applications.

    > Make sure you have all scim/skim related packages uninstalled and all
    > required ibus packages installed. Also make sure you ran the im-switch
    > command (with sudo) and set ibus in auto mode.

  • Japanese/Chinese/Korean/etc input work in KDE apps but no in GTK (Firefox,
    Chrome, Skype) apps!

    > This happens if you do not have the ibus-gtk module installed or do not
    > set the im-switch to auto.

  • Japanese/Chinese/Korean/etc input work in GTK (Firefox, Chrome, Skype) apps
    but no in KDE apps!

    > This happens if you do not have the ibus-qt4 module installed or do not
    > set the im-switch to auto.
