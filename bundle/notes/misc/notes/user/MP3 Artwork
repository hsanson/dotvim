MP3 Artwork

# Introduction

I needed a command line (cli) application that would allow me to embed cover
art to my MP3 collection in order to get the covers diplay correctly in my
wife's iPhone and my own gPhone (HTC-Hero). After months looking I finally
found the ideal tool: eyed3.


# Embedding cover art in MP3 files

In Ubuntu/Kubuntu install ImageMagick and Eyed3 with the following command:
{{{sh
sudo aptitude install imagemagick eyed3
}}}
Then get your cover art in JPG or PNG format using your favorite cover art
download tool (I use amarok) or scan your original CD case. Finally use this
command to embed the image in the MP3 files:
{{{sh
convert AlbumArt.jpg -resize 300x300\> AlbumArt.jpg
eyeD3 --add-image AlbumArt.jpg:FRONT_COVER *.mp3
}}}
The first command uses ImageMagick to resize the image if any dimension is
larger than 300px. The second command adds the cover art to all the MP3
files present in the current directory. You can of course use the full path
of the location where the MP3 files are located or better write a bash
script to apply the covert art to all your MP3 collection.

Note that the cover image is called AlbumArt.jpg and that the resize
operation overwrites it. If you prefer to keep the original change the name
of the output to something else. Also you can embed more than one image to
each MP3 and assign it different types like FRONT_COVER, BACK_COVER, MEDIA,
etc. Check eyeD3 help for more information.

The embedded cover art will display correctly in iTunes, iPhone and gPhone
without problems.

# Android cover art for Ogg/Vorbis and MP3 files

All my Japanese music is in Ogg/Vorbis format mostly because MP3 players
cannot agree in the metadata encoding for Japanese characters. Each MP3
player I have tried (including Amarok) use a custom (i.e. no standard) way
to save non ASCII characters making it impossible to display Japanese
correctly in all devices/players I use.

In the other hand Ogg/Vorbis displays the Japanese correctly in all players
I use (Amarok/gPhone/ffmpeg/mplayer). The problem I had was with cover art
until recently.

To get my Android phone to correctly display the cover art I had to organize
my music in different folders by album and in each album create an
AlbumArt.jpg file that will be used as cover art for all Ogg/Vorbis files
inside that album/folder.

  > |--Aerosmith
  > |    |-- Armageddon
  > |            |-- AlbumArt.jpg
  > |            |-- I Dont Want To Miss A Thing.ogg
  > |--Shakira
  >     |-- Laundry Service
  >              |--AlbumArt.jpg
  >              |--Eyes Like Yours.ogg

With this layout both Amarok and my Android Phone display the AlbumArt,jpg
for all the ogg/mp3 files contained inside the same folder. The cover art
image MUST be called AlbumArt or Android won't recognize it.
