# Introduction

This repository contains my personal neovim configuration that has been evolving
and changing over the years.

# Pre-requisities

I use Ubuntu Linux mainly so these configuration files are tested on Ubuntu
10.04 ~ 15.04 and Debian Jessie.

## Usage

Install neovim v0.1.0 or newer and clone this repo inside your XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config folder if XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set:

    git clone https://github.com/hsanson/dotvim $HOME/.config/nvim

finally ensure you read the init.vim file for further installation steps and to learn what is enabled in it.
